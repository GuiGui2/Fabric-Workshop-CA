That guide will allow you to run the lab on a SLES guest on LinuxONE community cloud. The guide includes links to everything and information on how to get a LinuxONE Community Cloud guest.



## Architecture

![Flow Diagram](images/FlowDiagram.png)



This lab will guide you through the following process.

1. Access your LinuxONE guest.
3. Setup and verify of your blockchain environment.
4. Create a blockchain project in Hyperledger Composer.
5. Interact with blockchain and third party APIs through Composer Rest Server and NodeRed.


## Application Overview
This blockchain lab is intended to give you a basic understanding of how a developer would interact with Hyperledger Fabric using Hyperledger Composer. In this workshop you will use a browser based UI to modify chaincode, test your code and deploy your changes. You will also learn how tooling can take the code and generate API to allow for application integration through a REST-ful interface. 

This lab will be broken into three parts: 

### Part 1 — Setup your LinuxONE guest

11. [Interacting with blockchain through a dashboard](#interacting-with-blockchain-through-a-dashboard)



## Workshop Instructions

### Scenario Overview
For this lab, we will simulate a thermostat and a temperature gauge to provide us temperature data. In a real world scenario, this could be a temperature sensor in your house or in an office building. The sensor could be connected to a real thermostat like Nest or other smart home devices via API. To keep family members, housemates, friends or children from excessively running air conditioning or heat, they must first find out if they have permission to adjust the thermostat by running a transaction defined in a smart contract running on Hyperledger Fabric. The contract will check the value recorded in the ledger for the temperature gauge to determine if their thermostat adjustment is environmentally friendly. Secondly, it will add integration to Weather.com to check current temperatures and adjust the thermostat to ideal settings based on the terms of the smart contract. 

### Part 1 - Setup your LinuxONE guest

In this section of the lab, you will use PuTTy to connect to your LinuxONE guest, setup your blockchain environment and verify everything is running. Your guest is a basic Ubuntu 17.0 server running on an IBM Z server residning in Montpellier, France. You can verify your Ubuntu version the command, `uname -a` , once you're logged into your guest.

#### Access your LinuxONE guest

1. At your workstation, you should be given the IP address of a Linux guest you will be working with. Keep this information available throughout the lab.

2. This lab document assumes your lab instructors have already started your VPN for you. If you cannot get the next step to work, please ask a lab instructor for assistance.

3. **Open** your terminal and use ssh or PuTTy to connect to your guest.. Once you're connected you should see something like the image below.

   ```
   Welcome to Ubuntu 17.10 (GNU/Linux 4.13.0-43-generic s390x)
   * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com
   * Management:     https://landscape.canonical.com
   * Support:        https://ubuntu.com/advantage

   * Meltdown, Spectre and Ubuntu: What are the attack vectors,
    how the fixes work, and everything else you need to know
    - https://ubu.one/u2Know

   9 packages can be updated.
   0 updates are security updates.
   ```

   #### Setup your blockchain environment

4. To save time in this lab, the pre-requisites for this lab are already installed. Use the following commands to verify installation.

   * Node: `node -v`
   
   * NPM: `npm -v`
   
   * Docker: `docker -v`

   * Docker Compose: `docker-compose -v`

   * Hyperledger Composer: `composer -v`

   * Hyperledger Fabric: `docker images`

  ![Verify the environment pre-requisites are installed.](images/verifyPreReqs.png)

5. To be ready to build your first blockchain application, you'll need to get everything running. This has been scripted for you. Copy the script to your guest using the following command.

   ```
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuiGui2/Fabric-Workshop-CA/master/labs/composer/ComposerLabSetup.sh
   ```

6. Make the script executable. Check to make sure the script is there and excutable.

   ```
   chmod u+x ComposerLabSetup.sh
   ls
   ```

7. Enter `./ComposerLabSetup.sh` to run the script.
* Note: Don't worry about the errors during the Node-RED installation. It still works. You will need to exit and log back in to your guest.
   ![Results of successful completion of setup script.](images/finishedSetupScript.png)

   ​
#### Verify the installation of Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer

8. To see if your blockchain network is up and running, use the command `docker ps -a`. You should see 4 containers with image names like the ones shown below.

![Running fabric containers.](images/RunningFabricContainers.png)

9. Verify Composer Playground is running by looking for its process using the command, `ps -ef|grep playground`. 

![Verify Composer Playground is running.](images/VerifyComposerPlaygroundRunning.png)

10. Open a browser and enter `xxx.xxx.x.x:8080` into the address bar where the x's correspond to your Linux guest's IP address. 

* **Note:** It is recommended to use Chrome as your browser for Hyperledger Composer Playground. It is also recommended that you open the Playground in a Incognito Window. This allows you to quickly clear cache and history if you start noticing odd behaviors.
* **Note:** If you use Firefox, you cannot use it in Private mode. 
* You should see the following:

![Loading Composer Playground.](images/ComposerPlaygroundUI1.png)

![Loaded Composer Playground.](images/ComposerPlaygroundUI2.png)

11. Congratulations! Part 1 is now complete! Lets get to work on the fun part. :smiley:

### Part 2 — Creating a blockchain application and generating API

#### Importing the components of your blockchain application

1. To get the base code files you'll be working with, you'll need to clone the GitHub repo. In a place of your choosing on your laptop:

   `git clone https://github.com/GuiGui2/Fabric-Workshop-CA.git`

2. Go back to your browser that has Composer Playground open. If you've closed it, you can open it in your browser by entering `xxx.xxx.x.x:8080` into the address bar where the x's correspond to your Linux guest's IP address.


* **Note:** You will need to view the browser in Full Screen (fully expanded) mode to be able to access everything and prevent issues with inability to scroll on certain screens.

![View Composer Playground.](images/ComposerPlaygroundUI2.png)

3. Select **Deploy a new business network** under *Connection: Web Browser*.

![Select Deploy a new business network.](images/SelectImportReplace.png)

4. Complete the *BASIC INFORMATION*.

* Give your new Business Network a name: **blockchain-journery**

* Describe what your Business Network will be used for: **Creating my first blockchain network.**

  ![Complete the Basic Information](images/basicinfo.png)

5. Scroll until you can see *Choose a Business Network Definition to start with:* and select **empty-business-network** and **Deploy**.
   ![Click empty-business-network and Deploy.](images/EmptyBusinessNetwork.png)

6. * From *My Wallet* select **Connect now** to go into your business network.

![Select Connect now.](images/ConnectNow.png)

7. Select **Add a File**.

    ![Select Add a File.](images/AddFile.png)


8. From the *Add a file* pop-up dialog, select **browse**.

    ![Select browse.](images/SelectBrowse.png)

9. In the file explorer window, navigate to where you downloaded the files from GitHub. 

  **In the `. . ./Fabric-Workshop-CA/labs/composer/code/` add the following:**

* *org.acme.sample.cto* — This is located in the models folder. In this exercise you'll use this file to create a model for your asset and transactions. You could also create participants in this file. This is similar to creating a Java class and defining what you would need in the class.
* *logic.js* — This is located in the lib folder. This is a JavaScript file that becomes the brains of your application. In this file is code, your smart contract, that defines how a transaction can happen. This is similar to Java methods.
* **Add last:** *permissions.acl* — This is where you would limit permissions for participants in a blockchain network.

10. Remove the empty model file from your Composer Playground.

* `models/model.cto`

  ![Delete model.cto.](images/DeleteFiles.png)

  ![Select Delete File.](images/DeleteFile.png)

  ​

  ​

13. Your files are all now loaded into Composer Playground. **Click** *Deploy Changes* on the left side of the browser. 

![Click Deploy.](images/InitialDeploy.png)

#### Creating your blockchain application

14. Click on **Model File**.

![Click Model File](images/SelectModelFile.png)

15. Click in the **editor** on the right to begin writing your models. 

* NOTE: **DO** **NOT** modify the namespace during the lab.

  ![Click in the editor](images/ClickEditor.png)

16. On a new line, give your asset `Sensor` the following attributes.

* Note: a small "o" is used as a bullet in the model.

* `o String teamID` — this will be the value that is assigned to your team. (already there!)

* `o String teamName`— this could be anything! Come up with something clever!

* `o Double sensorTemp` — temperature from the Raspberry Pi will be stored here.

* `o Double thermostatTemp`— you will create a temperature for the thermostat.

* `o String recommendation`— this will be populated based on the `CompareWeather` transaction.

* **Click** *Deploy changes* to save changes.

  ![Sensor model](images/SensorModel.png)

17. Now create your first transaction model for `SetSensorTemp`. Enter the following attributes:

* `--> Sensor gauge` — The transaction will need to put data into the `Sensor` asset. This passes a reference to the asset so we can work with the asset in the logic for the transaction.

* `o Double newSensorValue` — This is the variable that will be set by the temperature passed into the transaction from the NodeRed Sensor for picking up temperature.

* *Click** *Deploy changes* to save changes.

  ![Create SetSensorTemp model](images/SetSensorTempModel.png)

18. Build your `ChangeThermostatTemp` transaction model. Add the following:

* `--> Sensor thermostat` — The transaction will need to put data into the `Sensor` asset for the thermostat. This passes a reference to the asset so we can work with the asset in the logic for the transaction.

* `o Double newThermostatValue` — This allows for a new, proposed value to be sent into the transaction. In the logic tab, we will use this value to compare to what the gauge says and decide if the thermostat value should be adjusted.

* **Click** *Deploy changes* to save changes.

  ![Create ChangeThermostatTemp model](images/ChangeThermostatModel.png)

19. Enter the following values to build your `CompareWeather` transaction model:

* `--> Sensor recommend` — The transaction will need to put data into the `Sensor` asset. This passes a reference to the asset so we can work with the asset in the logic for the transaction.
* `o Double outsideTemp` — Looking at the [WeatherUnderground.com API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/conditions) for Conditions, you can see all of the possible data that the call could return. Based on the data, it was decided to take the actual outside temperature and the feels like temperature to give a recommendation on thermostat settings. This variable stores the value passed into it via NodeRed from Weather.com for the outside temperature.  The model on the API page shows up whether the data is returned in Celsius or Fahrenheit and its variable type. In this exercise we will use Celsius.

* `o Double feelsLike`— the variable to store the feels_like value from Weather.com.

* **Click** *Deploy changes* to save changes.

  ![create CompareWeather model](images/CompareWeatherModel.png)

20. Click on the **Script File** tab.

![Click Script File](images/ClickScriptFile.png)



21. **Review the code in the editor. **Verify that your variable names match the variable names here.  Capitalization does matter! If names don't match, you'll have errors. 

* Any guesses what the code is doing for each transaction?

  ![Review code](images/ReviewScriptFile.png)

#### Test application code

22. Click on the **Test** tab at the top to try out your code.

![Click Test](images/ClickTest.png)

23. Notice that in this particular case because we have no participants, the **Test** tab has opened to the **Asset** menu on the left. You must have an asset to be able to run any of the transactions.

* Click **Create New Asset**.

  ![Click Create New Asset](images/CreateNewAsset.png)

24. Create an example asset to test your code by filling in the following information:

* `"teamID": "teamID:**xxx**"` where ** **xxx** ** is any team number you'd like.

* `"teamName":""` — this could be any name you'd like. Be clever! :bowtie:

* `"sensorTemp": **0**` — Set ** **0** ** to any value. When you work with NodeRed, temperatures will be in Celsius.

* `"thermostatTemp": **0** `— Set ** **0** ** to any value. This is initializing your thermostat so pick a value you want to work with.

* `"recommendation": "" `— Leave this as is.

* *Make a note somewhere** of the values you used for `sensorTemp` and `thermostatTemp`.

  ![Create asset](images/NewAssetValues.png)

25. Click **Create New**.

![Click Create New](images/ClickCreateNew.png)

26. Once your **Team** asset is created it should show in the registry as shown below.

![Asset registry](images/Team01Asset.png)

27. You're ready to run your first transaction. **Click** on *Submit Transaction*.

![Click Submit Transaction](images/ClickSubmitTransaction.png)

28. The **Submit Transaction** dialog will open a new window. 

* Make sure that the **Transaction Type** is set to `SetSensorTemp`.

* Modify the JSON data`"gauge": "resource:org.acme.sample.Sensor#xxxx"`  — enter your team's identifier in place of the value where **xxxx** is in the sample JSON data.

* Modify the JSON data`"newSensorValue": 0` — enter a value your sensor could have.

* Click **Submit**.

  ![Submit SetSensorTemp](images/SetSensorTempTran.png)

29. If you submitted the transaction with your correct team ID, then you should have a transaction showing under *All Transactions*. **Click view record** to see the data you entered in the prior step. Congratulations! You've now completed a transaction. :thumbsup:

![Transaction Registry](images/TransactionRegistry.png)

30. Verify that `SetSensorTemp` updated the `sensorTemp`value in your asset. Click **Sensor**.

![Click Team](images/ClickSensor.png)

31. Check the `sensorTemp` value. Does it have the new value from the `SetSensorTemp` transaction?

![Check sensorTemp value](images/VerifySensorTemp.png)

32. Let's do another transaction. Select **Submit Transaction**.

![Select Submit Transaction](images/SubmitTransaction2.png)

33. This time let's run, `ChangeThermostatTemp`. 

* In the **Transaction Type** drop down, select `ChangeThermostatTemp`.
  ![Select ChangeThermostatTemp](images/SelectChangeThermostat.png)

* Edit the sample JSON for the transaction`"thermostat": "resource:org.acme.sample.Sensor#xxxx"`— change **xxxx** to your team ID value.

* Edit the sample JSON for the transaction`"newThermostatValue": 0` — Replace **0** with a value to which you would like to see if you can adjust the thermostat.

* Click **Submit**.

  ![Submit ChangeThermostatTemp](images/ChangeThermostatTran.png)

* If you select a temperature for the thermostat that is not within 3 degrees of the `sensorTemp` value, then you will get an error message like the one below. If you get this message, enter another value and click submit.

  ![ChangeThermostatTemp Error Message](images/ChangeThermostatError.png)

* If you do have permission to adjust the thermostat, you will be returned back to the transaction registry where you can see the data you just submitted.

  ![Successful Transaction](images/TransactionRegistry2.png)

* If for some reason you forget to modify your teamID value or update it to the wrong value, you will see an error like the one shown below. Check your value for teamID and try again.

  ![Asset does not exist error message](images/TeamIDError.png)

34. Verify that the last transaction updated your asset. Click **Sensor**.

![Click Sensor](images/ClickSensor2.png)

35. Verify that the `thermostatTemp` attribute for your Team has been updated to the value you gave successsfully in the `ChangeThermostatTemp` transaction.

* **Note**: In step 40, you can verify that the thermostat was originally set to 20 and is now set to 16.

  ![Verify thermostatTemp value](images/VerifyThermostatTemp.png)

36. Time to work with the `CompareWeather` transaction. Click **Submit Transaction**.

![Click Submit Transaction](images/SubmitTransaction3.png)

37. Select **CompareWeather** from the *Transaction Type* drop down.

![Select CompareWeather](images/Part1_Step36.png)

38. Complete the **CompareWeather** transaction.

* Modify the JSON, `"recommend": "resource:org.acme.sample.Sensor#xxxx"`— Replace **xxxx** with your team ID.

* Modify the JSON for`"outsideTemp": 0`— Enter a value for an outside temperature.

* Edit the JSON for`"feelsLike": 0` — Enter a value for what temperature it could feel like outside.

* Click **Submit**.

  ![Complete CompareWeather](images/CompareWeatherTran.png)

39. Verify that your transaction is showing in the Transaction Registry.

![Transaction Registry](images/TransactionRegistry3.png)

40. Click on **Sensor**. 

![Click Sensor](images/ClickSensor3.png)

41. Verify there is now a message in the `recommendation`variable in your Team asset and that the `thermostatValue` has been updated to the recommended value.

![Team asset recommendation value](images/VerifyRecommendation.png)

42. Continue testing your code for all scenarios to understand what your contract(s) can do. The hints to the remaining scenarios are as follows: (Yes, you'll have to look at the Script File under the Define Tab to figure out the criteria.)

* ChangeThemostatTemp:
  - [ ] A successful transaction where the `thermostatValue` is updated in the Sensor asset.
  - [ ] An error message in the *Submit Transaction* window advising you do not have permission to adjust the thermostat.
* CompareWeather:
  - [ ] A transaction based on `outsideTemp` values where it is really hot.
  - [ ] A transaction based on `outsideTemp` values where it is quite nice.
  - [ ] A transaction based on `outsideTemp` values where it is cold.
  - [ ] A transaction based on `feelsLike` values where it hot.
  - [ ] A transaction based on `feelsLike` values where it is quite nice.
  - [ ] A transaction based on `feelsLike` values where it is cold.

* **Note:** You should verify that your asset values have been updated appropriately after each transaction like you did in prior steps.

#### Deploy application to Hyperledger Fabric

43. Back in your browser where Hyperledger Composer Playground is running, **click** the *Define* tab and then **click** *Export* to save your code to your desktop. This is a safety measure. Export saves all of the indivudual files we imported at the beginning of Part 2 into a compressed file called a business network archive (.bna).
